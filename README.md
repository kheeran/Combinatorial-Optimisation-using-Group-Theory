# Pocket Cube

The goal of this mini project in mathematics is to study and understand the mathematical structute of the Rubik's Cube. In doing so, I showed how studying the mathematical structure allows us to make mathematical optimisations to find solutions to problems much more quickly than using naive brute force methods. In particular I looked at the problem of finding God's number for a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube, comonly called the Pocket Cube.

The file report.pdf details the research I have done including a comprehensive background on the mathematical structure of the Rubik's cube.

Disclaimer: *This is the first report I have written and my first strides to writing papers*
